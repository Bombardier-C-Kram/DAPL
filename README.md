# Discord APL

To run, simply link using `]LINK.Create dapl .` and then copy the .env.sample file to .env, complete the values, and run `dapl.DAPL.Run`

Currently I am not sure what the best way to actually stop the bot is. I am simply doing a strong inturrupt right now, but I am sure there exists a better way...
