# Discord APL

To run, make a .env file by copying the contents of .env.sample and adding the information there. Then generate the certificates, instructions in cert folder. Then link using `]LINK.Create dapl .` and run `dapl.DAPL.Run`

Currently I am not sure what the best way to actually stop the bot is. I am simply doing a strong inturrupt right now, but I am sure there exists a better way...
